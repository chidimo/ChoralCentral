In 1749, he was apprenticed to a hairdresser, in Crutched Friars, London.  Hearing a discourse preached by Whitefield on \"The Wrath to Come,\" in 1752, he was deeply impressed, and after a period of much disquietude, he gave himself to a religious life.  His own peculiar account of this change of life is as follows:--\"Robertus Michaelis Marineque Robinson filius.  Natus Swaffhami, comitatu Norfolciae, Saturni die Sept. 27, 1735.  Renatus Sabbati die, Maii 24, 1752, per predicationem potentem Georgii Whitefield.

He was popular as a preacher, and had no inconsiderable reputation as a musical composer. He ceased preaching on the publication of his work Thelyphthora, in which he advocated the practice of polygamy. He died in 1790.

He was a bright youth, translating a Latin classic into English verse by the time he was seven, entering Oxford at 17, and winning two awards for his poetry during his time there. After his graduation he became rector of his father's church in the village of Hodnet near Shrewsbury in the west of England where he remained for 16 years. He was appointed Bishop of Calcutta in 1823 and worked tirelessly for three years until the weather and travel took its toll on his health and he died of a stroke.

His mother, a pious Dissenter, stored his childish mind with Scripture, but died when he was seven years old. At the age of eleven, after two years' schooling, during which he learned the rudiments of Latin, he went to sea with his father. His life at sea teems with wonderful escapes, vivid dreams, and sailor recklessness. He grew into an abandoned and godless sailor.
