Splendid you passed, the great surrender made;\nInto the light that nevermore shall fade;\nDeep your contentment in that blest abode,\nWho wait the last clear trumpet call of God.\n4. Long years ago, as earth lay dark and still,\nRose a loud cry upon a lonely hill,\nWhile in the frailty of our human clay,\nChrist, our Redeemer, passed the self same way.\n5. Still stands His cross from that dread hour to this,\nLike some bright star above the dark abyss;\nStill, through the veil, the Victor\u2019s pitying eyes\nLook down to bless our lesser Calvaries.\n6. These were His servants, in His steps they trod,\nFollowing through death the martyred Son of God:\nVictor, He rose; victorious too shall rise\nThey who have drunk His cup of sacrifice.\n7. O risen Lord, O Shepherd of our dead,\nWhose cross has bought them and whose staff has led,\nIn glorious hope their proud and sorrowing land\nCommits her children to Thy gracious hand.Source: The Cyber Hymnal #5480",
