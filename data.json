His hymn:\u2014\nWhat a Friend we have in Jesus. [Jesus our Friend] was, according to Mr. Sankey, discovered to be his in the following manner: \"A neighbour, sitting up with him in his illness, happened upon a manuscript of 'What a Friend we have in Jesus.' Reading it with great delight, and questioning Mr. Scriven about it, he said he had composed it for his mother, to comfort her in a time of special eorrow, not intending any one else should see it.\" We find the hymn in H. 1...

Soon tiring of that he entered upon a similar situation at Wath, near Rotherham, only to find it quite as unsuitable to his taste as the former. A journey to London, with the hope of finding a publisher for his youthful poems ended in failure; and in 1792 he was glad to leave Wath for Shefield to join Mr. Gales, an auctioneer, bookseller, and printer of the Sheffield Register newspap\u2026\u00a0Go to person page >",

O valiant hearts who to your glory came\nThrough dust of conflict and through battle flame;\nTranquil you lie, your knightly virtue proved,\nYour memory hallowed in the land you loved.\n2. Proudly you gathered, rank on rank, to war\nAs who had heard God\u2019s message from afar;\nAll you had hoped for, all you had, you gave,\nTo save mankind\u2014yourselves you scorned to save.\n3. Splendid you passed, the great surrender made;\nInto the light that nevermore shall fade;\nDeep your contentment in that blest abode,\nWho wait the last clear trumpet call of God.\n4. Long years ago, as earth lay dark and still,\nRose a loud cry upon a lonely hill,\nWhile in the frailty of our human clay,\nChrist, our Redeemer, passed the self same way.\n5. Still stands His cross from that dread hour to this,\nLike some bright star above the dark abyss;\nStill, through the veil, the Victor\u2019s pitying eyes\nLook down to bless our lesser Calvaries.\n6. These were His servants, in His steps they trod,\nFollowing through death the martyred Son of God:\nVictor, He rose; victorious too shall rise\nThey who have drunk His cup of sacrifice.\n7. O risen Lord, O Shepherd of our dead,\nWhose cross has bought them and whose staff has led,\nIn glorious hope their proud and sorrowing land\nCommits her children to Thy gracious hand.Source: The Cyber Hymnal #5480",

He shall come down like showers\nupon the fruitful earth;\nlove, joy, and hope, like flowers,\nspring in his path to birth.\nBefore him on the mountains,\nshall peace, the herald, go,\nand righteousness, in fountains,\nfrom hill to valley flow.\n4.
